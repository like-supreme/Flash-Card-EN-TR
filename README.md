# Flash-Card-EN-TR
A minimal Tkinter-based English → Turkish flash card application. Words are loaded from a CSV file, each card automatically flips after 2.5 seconds, and progress is tracked locally. When you mark a word as “✅ learned,” it’s removed from the pool and saved to a CSV file.  The project is simple, file-based, and easily customizable.
